# Javascript Sandbox
-----

Here are some of the resoureces I've used while learning Javascript. 

I recommend VSCode Themes - https://vscodethemes.com/ for browsing themes.

### Themes

It provides the option to select a language from JS, HTML, CSS, C++, Java, Python, GO and see how the theme renders that. You can specify if you want light, dark or both themes, search for particular themes, and sort the results by recency, installs, trending and relevance. 

(The using CSS view is important for me because I want to see that the CSS value is a different colour than the unit, if they are the same I skip that theme)
